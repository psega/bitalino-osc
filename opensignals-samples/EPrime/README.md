# Integration of E-Prime in OpenSignals

E-Prime is a software used to design and run psychological experiments, with a focus on psychological and cognitive science. The integration of E-Prime in Opensignals allows researchers
to synchronize physiological data with stimuli, providing insights on psychological reflexes. To achieve this, both softwares need to be configured.

This repository contains an E-Prime experiment ready to use with OpenSignals. Instructions on how to create your own experiment and configure OpenSignals can be found [here](https://www.downloads.plux.info/OpenSignals/OpenSignals%20E-Prime%20Integration%20-%20Quick%20Start%20Guide.pdf).
